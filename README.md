## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

* I didn't use any outside resources to complete the pre-work. The Codepath resources were helpful and informative (including the hints and logic) to complete this entire program.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

* Recently I'm searching for internship opportunities on LinkedIn and came to know about the Futurepath Tech Launchpad just a day before the deadline. I did not encounter any challenge doing this pre-work as I love technology and working on it. But, I have only one day to submit this(I came to know about this just one day before the deadline). 

* Also, I'm on the last week of my current semester and have to spend all my time on my final project submissions and exams. But I thought completing this SITE program and joining this program would benefit me in my career, I spent 2 hours on this task and completed it successfully. Thanks a lot to the detailed instructions and notes that helped me to finish the project easily.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
   
* I would like to know how we will deploy this project/any other project and make it a real-world project.
   
* I would like to know how to make those colorful buttons movable so that the user can drag them wherever they want?
   
4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

* If I had more time to work on this project, I would like to create a signup page for user's that will take users name, email address, password.
* A login page where the user should give their credentials to login.
* We can navigate from one page to another page easily using the options.
* The password should be atleast * characters and a combination of alphabets, numbers and special characters
* This helps us to know who are playing our game so that we can send email notifications/advertisements to the users regarding the game in future.
* For this I have to use a database to take all the users information and I think this is very interesting part.
* I would like to add different background images to all the pages which attracts the users to play our game.
